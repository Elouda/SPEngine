	// We mention E-1, but using this class for an E-1 is not a great idea: it's too heavy and the unlock costs are far too high.  Also, the techRequired is a bit late, because otherwise you could build an almost F-1-sized engine four years too early; and the part model is fricken' huge too since we haven't figured out how to scale it yet.  OTOH, if you want an E-1 *and* an F-1, getting the E-1 from this class isn't all that expensive, and the per-engine cost is really cheap, so you *might* choose it.
