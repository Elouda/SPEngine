	// Gamma's performance (even taking into account the density of HTP) isn't that great; its USP is high reliability (no failures out of 128 engines launched).
	// Post-Gamma, peroxide hasn't flown much, so there aren't any reliable numbers to go on.  Thus, everything after the second TL should be taken as speculative.
